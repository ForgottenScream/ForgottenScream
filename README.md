- Hi, I’m @ForgottenScream - the alias was randomly generated.

- I’m interested in linux and other operating systems (hence the dotfiles) and interested in   programming scripts for automation and generally creating new things.

- I’m currently learning a few things, some in my own time others while working. The projects I publish on here will reflect my interests and skills as this is the way I apply my knowledge.
